Pricing is based on job complexity, timing, and distance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I set up a recurring order during season without having to place an order each week?",
        "answer": "Yes, many of our clients order for the entire season in October. Not only does this leave one less item to worry about when things are crazy, but we can also often apply a small discount if all orders are confirmed at one time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the wrapping process for ice sculptures?",
        "answer": "All sculptures that go in boxes will have plastic padding on the bottom and top to prevent damage. Every sculpture is wrapped in plastic to prevent sticking to surfaces and to stay insulated. For blanket wrapping, all sculptures are wrapped in plastic, with a blanket to insulate and protect them from damages."
